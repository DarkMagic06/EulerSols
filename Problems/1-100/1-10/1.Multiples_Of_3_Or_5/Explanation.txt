This is the explanation/thought process behind the solution of problem 1, Multiples of 3 or 5.

The problem is as follows,

*If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3,5,6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.*

This was my second introduction to the site,
so I was thinking that I need to implement an algorithm in a programming language to make this work.
The thing is I needed to select a programming language, for now I will be using C and then expanding to Python and Rust

I needed to scan every number below 1000 (starting from 1 through 999) which is my upper bound and see which numbers when divided by 3 or 5 had 0 as the remainder

So using the modulo operation (%) and a for loop should be sufficient to implement the algorithm.

One could make a case for creating two separate for loops but they would have to account for the common numbers which are multiples of 15


If you want to attempt it on your own pace, please do so but my solution for the problem (including an algorithm for any upper bound) is on the .c file

Reminder to add python and Rust implementations
