## Problem Statement

*If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3,5,6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.*


## Personal Notes
This was my second introduction to the site, also a long time since using C as a programming tool.
I wanted to use Python and Rust but I don't yet have the necessary knowledge even though the problem is mostly trivial.

## Thought Process
We need the multiples of 3 and 5 below a certain upper bound (in this case 1000). There could be a case where we could use 2 separate for loops counting all the multiples of 3 and 5 separately.
The thing is, the time complexity could shoot up high, maybe a hardware parallel implementation with 2 modules ,one for counting the 3 multiples and one for the 5 multiples, could significantly lower the time and power costs
For the C implementation, the brute force approach seems most reasonable because there seems to be a case for the 15 multiples being counted twice. All that said, further optimizations could prove more efficient on time and hardware constraints

## Initial Approach
Brute force, works well because upper limit is only 1000

## Implementation Notes
- Language: C
- Key insight: modulo operation with OR condition
- Edge case: multiples of 15 counted once

## Optimizations Considered
[future: arithmetic series approach]

## Future Work
- [ ] Python implementation
- [ ] Rust implementation  
- [ ] Mathematical O(1) solution
